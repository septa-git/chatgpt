<h1>ChatGPT - A JavaScript clone of OpenAI’s chatbot</h1> <blockquote><p>This is ChatGPT version 3.5 turbo, 3.5 turbo 0301.<br> <em>GPT 4 has not been tested yet.</em></p></blockquote> <img src=“https://github.com/alexsky177/chat/blob/main/screen_dark.png?raw=true” alt=“chatgpt”/> <p>ChatGPT is a web application that lets you chat with an AI-powered chatbot using OpenAI’s API. You can customize the chatbot’s personality, memory, and style by changing the system message and the temperature settings. You can also switch between dark and light themes for the interface.</p> <p>To use ChatGPT, you need to follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Download the ZIP file or use the git command from this GitHub repository.</li> <li>Get your OpenAI key from this website.</li> <li>Open the config.js file and fill in your API key in this line: <code>const strIndex = “YOUR_API_KEY”;</code></li> <li>If you want to change the path of the application, you can modify this line: <code>const path = “/chat”;</code>. For the root directory, use <code>const path = “”;</code></li> <li>If you want to change the system message of the chatbot, you can modify this line: <code>const system_message = “You are a smart robot!”;</code>. This will affect how the chatbot responds to your queries.</li> <li>Create a directory on your web server with the same name as the path you chose in step 4.</li> <li>Upload the index.html file and the assets folder to that directory.</li> <li>Type in your browser the address of your web server followed by the path of the application. For example, <code>https://your-website.com/chat/</code>.</li> <li>Enjoy chatting with ChatGPT!</li> </ol> <p>For security reasons, you may want to use an obfuscator to hide your API key in the config.js file. You can use this online tool for that purpose.</p> <p>This project is based on the front-end code from this GitHub repository (with some modifications) and the JavaScript OpenAI API request from this blog post.</p> <p>All the original features are preserved, except for the web search function, which has been replaced by a theme switch function. A temperature change function and a context memory function have been added. The chatbot will remember your previous questions and answers.</p> <h2>Run on localhost</h2> <p>You can also run this program on your local computer without a web server. Here is how to do it:</p> <h3>How to install localhost</h3> <p>Read this Stack Overflow solution for different options to run HTML files on localhost.</p> <p>You can use Node.js or Python as a local server.</p> <p>How to install the app on Python:</p> <ol> <li>Install Python from this website.</li> <li>Create a directory named <code>chat</code>.</li> <li>Change the path in the config.js file to <code>path = “”;</code>.</li> <li>Change the root in the config.js file to <code>root = “.”;</code> (just delete <code>//</code>).</li> <li>Put the index.html file and the assets folder in the chat directory.</li> </ol> <div> On the Windows command line or in the Mac terminal, type <pre><code>cd chat</code></pre> then<pre><code>python -m http.server</code></pre></div> <ul> <li>Open in your browser one of these addresses: <code>http://192.168.1.52:8000/</code>, <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/</code>, or <code>http://localhost:8000/</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Use the app on your local computer.</p> <img src=“https://github.com/alexsky177/chat/blob/main/screen_light.png?raw=true” alt=“chatgpt”/> <p><em>Last update: added conversations.<br> Removed all PHP files.<br> Changed the path for assets files.</em></p>
